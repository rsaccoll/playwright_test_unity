user.status === "active"

  "status": "active"
}``

Assert:

Updated name

HTTP status 200

**A random string is appended to the email to avoid conflicts

Note: For production or real-world testing, store tokens securely in a .env file.

Considerations:

UI Tests:
It doesn't seem to be working if you run it for testing.
1) The skipAll button appears to have a frame, and over time, it wasn't very feasible to bypass it when pressing it. I tried a workaround, but it didn't work.
2) The option to select the email address doesn't display items for adding first and last names. Perhaps the flow is going in the wrong direction. I left only the email address and password as that's what appeared (even after clearing the cache).

API tests:
Entering the same email address can cause conflicts. I chose to include a string in the email address to avoid conflicts when running the test.

Apparently, the terminal can sometimes return a page for validation. I chose to leave the test as it should be validated, but errors may occur when running it.
